# PhilipOS
a in Version = Alpha.
I was always interested in how Operating Systems really work, so i decided to give it a shot.
In this Project i am trying to build somewhat of an OS, it is my first time doing something like this,
especially using assembly, but i am interested in trying out something new. Since i am a Java developer and i 
have learned a bit of C++, i will try to experience the way a OS is created from the Kernel, until you
have something you can actually use.
Version Changelog:
V1.0a: the ISO File can be emulated and displays some Text. 
V1.1a: Adapted System to work with 64 Bit.
V1.2a: Coming Soon...
